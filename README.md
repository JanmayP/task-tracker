# Task Tracker made in React 
This is a UI-based task tracker app made with React components. 

## Purpose 
I created this project to solidify my React and Sass skills. I also wanted to implement a task tracker that is a little more fleshed out than a minimal one.

## Task Structure and Storage
All tasks support multiple subtasks to be added/deleted/marked as done. 
This app works without a backend. All information is stored in localstorage (in the browser) and persists when the window is closed. 

## Technology Used 
+ React
+ Sass

## Project deployed on Netlify
