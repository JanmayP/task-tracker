# Task Tracker made in React 
This is a UI-based task tracker app made with React components. 

## Purpose 
I created this project to solidify my React and Sass skills. I also wanted to implement a task tracker that is a little more fleshed out than a minimal one.

## Hierarchial Task Structure
All tasks support the addition of upto 3 subtasks. Tasks are saved to local storage.

## Technology Used 
+ React
+ Sass

## Project deployed on Netlify
